✨ Fun Fact
I once debugged a 500-line CSS file at 2 AM with nothing but coffee and sheer determination! ☕💻

/* Simple animation for GitHub README (works in some markdown renderers) */
@keyframes pulse {
  0% { transform: scale(1); }
  50% { transform: scale(1.1); }
  100% { transform: scale(1); }
}
.animated-emoji {
  display: inline-block;
  animation: pulse 2s infinite;
}


🚀 Let's build something amazing together!
